This is a collection of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) nodes that allow you control smart plugs and bulbs from the TP-Link smart home ecosystem.

This is a fork of so inspiring [node-red-contrib-tplink-smarthome
](https://github.com/Felixls/node-red-contrib-tplink-smarthome) with added functionality.

Under the hood, each node uses the awesome [TP-Link Smart Home API](https://github.com/plasticrake/tplink-smarthome-api).

# Installation

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

`$ npm install node-red-contrib-tplink`

or you can use the Palette Manager in Node-RED.

# Parameters

`Name` - Type in the name of the host manually or keep the default device name

`Device IP` - Type in the Device IP address manually or press the button to retrieve all locally available plug devices

`Poll interval` - Interval that is used to poll availability of devices *(>500ms / Recommended 5000-10000ms)*

`Event poll interval` - Interval that is used to poll active devices for events *(>500ms / Recommended 1000-3000ms)*

# Inputs

> payload: Object | string | boolean | array

## On/Off

```js
{
	"state": true // true is "on", false is "off", "toggle" sets the opposite power state
}
```

`true` - Turn on the device.

`false` - Turn off the device.

`toggle` - Toggle opposite power state of the device.

## Multi-Plug On/Off

```js
{
	"plug": 1 // whole number corresponding to "Plug" number on power strip.  Optional.
	"state": true // true is "on", false is "off", "toggle" sets the opposite power state
}
```

## Brightness

```js
{
	"brightness": [value 1-100]
}
```

`brightness:[value 1-100]`

*Example: Send payload as `brightness:25` to set brightness of the bulb to 25%.*

## LED Status Light

```js
{
	"led": true // true is "on", false is "off"
}
```

## Temperature

`temperature:[value 2700-6500]`

*Example: Send payload as `temperature:5000` to set temperature of the bulb to 5000k.*

## Color Support for Multicolor Bulbs
Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB) support for multicolor bulbs. 
```js
{
  "hsb": {
    "hue": 240,
    "saturation": 15,
    "brightness": 100
  }
}
```

## Commands

`getInfo` - Fetch the device information.

`getCloudInfo` - Fetch the device information from the cloud.

`getQuickInfo` - Fetch most popular proprieties, such as username, device consumption, mode, lighting state, and many more.  Supports multi-plug.

`getMeterInfo` - Fetch the current device consumption.  Supports multi-plug.

`clearEvents` - Unsubscribe events.

`eraseStats` - Clear all the meter statistics.  Supports multi-plug.

## Events

`getMeterUpdateEvents` - Subscribe to meter information events.  Event emits on event polling interval.

`getPowerEvents` - Subscribe to power on/off events.  Event emits on device/plug change.

`getPowerUpdateEvents` - Subscribe to power on/off events.  Event emits on event polling interval.

`getInUseEvents` - Subscribe to device usage events.  Event emits on device/plug change.

`getInUseUpdateEvents` - Subscribe to device usage events.  Event emits on event polling interval.

`getOnlineEvents` - Subscribe to online/offline events.  Event emits on poll interval.

*Multiple events can be used as an array via the `events` property.*

```js
{
	"events": ["getMeterUpdateEvents", "getPowerEvents"]
}
```
